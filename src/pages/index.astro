        I work on questions in climate change adaptation using models and methods from financial economics and empirical industrial organization. I am particularly interested in understanding how climate risk affect insurance firm behavior and how this, in turn, affects the accessibility of insurance for households and firms.
      <br/>
        <br/>
Before starting my PhD, I worked as an economist at the Central Bank of Chile. I hold a BSc in Engineering from Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile, and BSc and MSc in Applied Mathematics from Ã‰cole Polytechnique, France.
